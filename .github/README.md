The CITRIS UC Davis Visual Thinking Toolkit facilitates the creation of interactive VR "visual thinking" puzzles. It is based on the widely used Unity application framework, and currently supports the Oculus Quest VR headset.

The toolkit provides a set of application assets (e.g. 3D models, textures, scenes, source code) and a choice of puzzle type templates (currently three, but more are planned). It is designed to be extensible so that new puzzle types, assets, and game logic can be easily added.

CITRIS UC Davis has also created a few example Visual Thinking puzzles (one based on each puzzle type template) using the toolkit. The repositories for these can be found below:

 - [Folded Pattern](https://github.com/citris-ucdavis/foldedpattern)
 - [Rotating Dice](https://github.com/citris-ucdavis/rotatingdice)
 - [Nine Dots](https://github.com/citris-ucdavis/ninedots)
